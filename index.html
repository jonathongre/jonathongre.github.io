                        All you have to learn here is how to have fun. There are no mistakes. You can fix anything that happens. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Tree trunks grow however makes them happy.

                        There we are. Brown is such a nice color. Painting should do one thing. It should put happiness in your heart.

                        Nothing's gonna make your husband or wife madder than coming home and having a snow-covered dinner. The very fact that you're aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive and can experience it. This painting comes right out of your heart.
